# ACT Docusaurus Documentation

This is a base project for Docusaurus sites.  It includes most of the basic configurations that are common in order to provide an easy and consistent method for updating versions and adding base capabilities to a collection of docusaurus sites.

An implementation will typically just reference the configs and files from this repository.
